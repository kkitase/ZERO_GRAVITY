## Overview

**ZERO_GRAVITY** is the meta-framework repository for **GA-Workspace** (Google Antigravity Workspace).
This project serves as an experimental platform that provides a new development experience, freed from the constraints (gravity) of traditional development processes, and forms the foundation for next-generation agent-driven development.

This workspace incorporates an advanced governance model composed of **49+ definition files**, enabling autonomous project management centered around the following "Golden Triangle":

1.  **Tech Stack Rule (`stack.md`)**: Standardization of technology selection
2.  **Operational Rule (`ops.md`)**: Definition of operational processes
3.  **Core Workflows**: Automation of development cycles

## Features

GA-Workspace is designed based on the following principles:

- **Recursive Composition**: Efficiently solves complex tasks through hierarchical combinations of rules and workflows.
- **Rule-based Governance**: Agents autonomously make decisions and take actions according to policies defined in `.agent/rules`.
- **Automated Workflows**: Automates the entire development cycle based on procedures defined in `.agent/workflows`.

## Included Capabilities

This repository comes pre-configured with the following rules and workflows.

## Getting Started

This repository functions as a **source (template)** for new GA-Workspace projects.

### 1. Creating a New Project

```bash
# Initialize with Agent workflow
/setup-ga-workspace
```

### 2. Converting an Existing Project to GA-Workspace

```bash
# Convert target directory
/create-repo-from-folder
```

### 3. Extending the Environment

```bash
# Create new rule
/create-rule

# Define new workflow
/create-workflow
```
